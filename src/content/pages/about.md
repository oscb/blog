Hi,

When I was 7 years old I was introduced to **[Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>)** at my school's computer lab. I wasn't told that I was coding. It was just a game for me. I fell in love right away. I built chart graphing tools, interactive videogames, art.

10 years later when I had to choose a major to study - _Universities in Mexico, forcing you to make a life changing choice with your barely post-puberty brain_ - I rediscovered programming.

It was pure happenstance. We didn't study code in our computer lab, we studied to get Microsoft Office certifications - _I'm 2009's Mexico's 2nd place in Excel._ On my last semester we were a little ahead of our study program, so my teacher whom I will always be grateful for decided to spend a month teaching us to code in C.

That was a game changer. I always knew I loved computers but somehow never realized that I wanted to know how to write software on them. I never knew I already knew how, just with a little turtle painting things on screen instead of a dark screen with pointers and memory allocation problems.

This short story is just to say: **I love code**. Maybe a little bit too much.

Ever since choosing code I've worked in a lot of different stuff, you can read more about it in the sidebar.

Interviewers ask me: which one are you, backend, frontend, mobile, fullstack?

I have a really hard time answering that. **I'm curious, that's what I am.**

I live in the Seattle area, with my beautiful wife - she's a fantastic designer and a wonderful person - and our adopted cat, Matcha.

I love photography, books, cars.
